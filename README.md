2)Task 2: Implement a JavaScript Feature
To run JavaScript feature which allow users to filter a list of items based on specific criteria, we need to run command:-
   start FilterProducts.html or we simply click on html file it will run in default browser (I kept all css and javascript implementation in same file for simplicity in access)

Front-End Development Question:( Optional** )
In a few paragraphs, explain the importance of code splitting and lazy loading in modern
front-end development. How do these techniques benefit the user experience, and what are the
best practices for implementing them?
Ans:=>
Code splitting : Code splitting is the process of dividing a huge JavaScript bundle into smaller, more manageable portions. Code splitting enables you to only load the JavaScript code that is required for the current page or view, as opposed to sending the entire JavaScript script to the user's browser in one big file. As a result, the user's browser only needs to download the code necessary for the specific activity they are performing, which reduces the initial load time.

Lazy Loading: Lazy loading is a particular kind of code splitting in which you delay loading some resources (such as JavaScript modules, pictures, or styles) until you really need them. Due to the fact that it assures that the initial user only loads extra resources when they browse to the correct areas of the application, making page loading quick and effective.

Benefits for User Experience:-
Faster Initial Load: Code splitting and lazy loading reduce the quantity of code that must be downloaded initially, which speeds up load times. Users can begin using the application more quickly, which boosts how quickly people consider your website to be.

Reduced Data Usage: You can cut down on the amount of data that is carried over the network by merely loading the bare minimum of code and resources. Users with slower connections or data plans will find this to be especially helpful.

A greater overall performance and responsiveness of the program are achieved by using smaller code chunks, which the browser can parse and execute more quickly.
